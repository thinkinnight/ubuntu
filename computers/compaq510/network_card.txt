while the network card (wireless) cannot work, should use the following command to make it work.

# lsmod |grep "brcmsmac\|b43\|ssb\|bcma\|wl"

and if there are some existed modules.

# sudo rmmod xxx

# sudo modprobe lib80211
# sudo modprobe cfg80211

# cd ~/Downloads/hybrid_wl/
# sudo insmod wl.ko

But how to make it work while the PC startup?
